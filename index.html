            <h2>who am i</h2>
            <p>I am an Enterprise Technology Integration student at Penn State University with a strong focus on AI
                systems, blockchain innovation, and enterprise solutions. My academic path emphasizes both technical
                depth and business integration, equipping me to bridge the gap between emerging technologies and
                organizational needs. I have developed expertise in Python, Rust, and Java, alongside practical
                experience in AI frameworks such as TensorFlow and PyTorch, while also exploring applications of
                blockchain networks in scalable, real-world deployments.</p>

            <h2>what i have done</h2>
            <p>As Co-Founder and Director of Community Relations at <a
                    style="color:aliceblue; text-shadow: 0 0 3px #1E90FF;" href="https://pixellabz.io/"
                    target="_blank">PixelLabz</a> (then PixelPilotz), I helped architect a non-consensus RPC
                network in the Solana and Aptos ecosystems, raising nearly $180,000 through token sales and deploying
                infrastructure across the U.S., Germany, and Singapore. This project validated my ability to design,
                scale, and stress-test blockchain infrastructure under high transaction loads. In addition, I
                contributed to machine learning research for cybersecurity, where I developed active inference models
                that improved anomaly detection efficiency while reducing compute overhead. Professionally, I gained
                enterprise experience as an Information Security Analyst Intern at Nodestop, LLC, conducting
                vulnerability assessments, implementing risk mitigation, and supporting compliance efforts.</p>

        <section>
            <h2>what i will do</h2>
            <p>My future goal is to advance the integration of AI and blockchain into enterprise environments. I plan to
                pursue roles that focus on building secure, intelligent, and decentralized systems â€” from AI-driven risk
                management tools to scalable blockchain infrastructure for business and finance. By combining my
                entrepreneurial background with academic and professional experience, I aim to push the boundaries of
                how organizations adopt AI and distributed technologies, ultimately helping enterprises become more
                adaptive, secure, and innovative.</p>
